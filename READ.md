## TIC TAC TOE Project0 
The main goal was to make a simple Tic Tac Toe game.
This project was built as part of the Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly, Sydney 2019.

### Big Goals
  - Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
  - Use our programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
  - Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the application
  - Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
  - Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
  - Craft a readme.md file that explains the app to the world
  
#### Technical Requirements
- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

#### Technologies Used
- html
- css
- JavaScript
- jquery (jquery-1.7.2.js)

#### Further Development
* develop AI for the game
